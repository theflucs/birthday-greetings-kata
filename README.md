# Birthday Greetings Kata

## About

This repository implements the **Birthday Greetings Kata**, inspired by [Matteo Vaccari's blog post](https://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154). The goal of this exercise is to practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **clean code**, and **SOLID principles** by designing a system that sends birthday greetings to employees.

## Why This Kata?

This kata is designed to help developers:

- Apply **TDD** to drive the design of a real-world feature.
- Practice **refactoring** to improve code structure while keeping tests green.
- Learn to separate business logic from infrastructure concerns (e.g., file I/O, email sending).
- Develop **maintainable and scalable** software following **Uncle Bobâ€™s Clean Code** principles.
